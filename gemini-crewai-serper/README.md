# CrewAI with Chainlit

This folder demonstrates how to integrate CrewAI with Chainlit.  
CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents.

To run the example, follow the instructions below and refer to the [main readme](/README.md) for additional setup guidance.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Chainlit installed
- Google Gemini API key
- Serper API key

---

## Quickstart

To get started with using CrewAI in Chainlit, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository and navigate to the `gemini-crewai-serper` directory.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**  
   Ensure you have a Google Gemini API key and a Serper API key. Set these as environment variables in .env file by using the .env.example file as a template.

   Refer to the following documentation for generating API keys:  
   - [Google Gemini API Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)  
   - [Serper API Documentation](https://serper.dev/)

4. **Configure Agents and Tasks**  
   Update the `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files in the `config` folder to define your own agents and tasks if necessary.

5. **Run the Application**  
   Use the provided `app.py` file as a starting point to run your Chainlit app:

   ```shell
   chainlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Interact with the Application**  
   Open the Chainlit interface in your browser to interact with the AI agents. You'll be able to see conversations and responses orchestrated by CrewAI.

## Expected Output

After setting up and running the application, you should be able to:  
- Interact with AI agents through the Chainlit interface.  
- See responses generated by the crew, leveraging Google Gemini and Serper APIs.
